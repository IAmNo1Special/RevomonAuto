## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Weather Analysis

```python
from revomonauto.revomon.clients import WeatherClient, AbilitiesClient

# Initialize clients
weather_client = WeatherClient()
abilities_client = AbilitiesClient()

# Get all weather conditions
weather_conditions = weather_client.get_weather_conditions()
print(f"Available weather: {weather_conditions}")

    {"name": "electra", "type1": "electric"}
]

weather_analysis = weather_client.analyze_weather_strategy(team)
print(f"Optimal weather: {weather_analysis['recommended_weather']}")
print(f"Weather synergy: {weather_analysis['synergy_score']}")
```

### Weather Generation Analysis

```python
# Find weather generators in a team
generators = weather_client.find_weather_generators(team)
print(f"Weather generators found: {len(generators)}")

for generator in generators:

rain_team = [
    {"name": "blizzora", "type1": "ice", "type2": "water"},
    {"name": "electra", "type1": "electric"},
    {"name": "psyche", "type1": "psychic"}

print(f"Rain synergy: {rain_analysis['synergy_score']}/100")
print(f"Recommended moves: {rain_analysis['recommended_moves']}")
print(f"Weather benefits: {rain_analysis['weather_benefits']}")
```

### Example 2: Weather Generation Planning

    # Select weather beneficiaries
    beneficiaries = analysis['top_beneficiaries']

    # Combine into optimal team

    return team

# Build rain team
rain_team = build_weather_team("rain", all_revomon)
```

### Weather Control Strategy

# Develop weather control strategy
def develop_weather_control(current_team, target_weather):
    control_methods = weather_client.find_weather_generators(current_team)

    if not control_methods:
        # Recommend adding weather control
        recommendations = weather_client.get_weather_control_recommendations(target_weather)
        return recommendations

    return control_methods

# Get recommendations for sun control
sun_recommendations = develop_weather_control(current_team, "sun")
```

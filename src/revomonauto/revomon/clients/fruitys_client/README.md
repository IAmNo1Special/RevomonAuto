Berry and held item system client for Revomon, providing access to damage reduction mechanics, healing effects, priority manipulation, and type-triggered effects for defensive strategy optimization.

## üçì Overview

The FruitysClient provides the complete berry and held item system for Revomon:

- **Damage reduction** against super-effective attacks (type-resist berries)
- **Healing effects** and HP restoration mechanics
- **Priority manipulation** for speed control
- **Type-triggered effects** that activate against specific elemental types
- **Defensive strategy** optimization and counter-building
- **Held item** compatibility and team synergy

This client enables the defensive counterplay that balances Revomon's offensive systems and creates strategic depth in team building.

## üìä Fruity Data Structure

Each fruity (berry/held item) contains comprehensive effect information:

### Core Information
- **`name`** - Unique fruity identifier (primary key)
- **`description`** - Detailed effects and activation conditions
- **`type`** - Item type (appears to be "held" for all entries)

### Effect Categories
- **Damage Reduction** - Resist super-effective attacks
- **Healing Effects** - HP recovery and restoration
- **Priority Manipulation** - Speed control and turn order
- **Type-Triggered** - Effects that activate against specific types

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Fruity Lookup

```python
from revomonauto.revomon.clients import FruitysClient

# Initialize client
fruitys_client = FruitysClient()

# Get fruity by name
orcan_berry = fruitys_client.get_fruity("orcan berry")
if orcan_berry:
    print(f"Orcan Berry: {orcan_berry['description']}")

# Get damage-reducing berries
resist_berries = fruitys_client.get_damage_reducing_fruitys()
print(f"Damage-reducing berries: {len(resist_berries)}")
for berry in resist_berries:
    print(f"  {berry['name']}: {berry['description'][:50]}...")
```

### Healing and Support Analysis

```python
# Get healing berries
healing_fruitys = fruitys_client.get_healing_fruitys()
print(f"Healing berries: {len(healing_fruitys)}")

# Get priority manipulation items
priority_fruitys = fruitys_client.get_priority_fruitys()
print(f"Priority berries: {len(priority_fruitys)}")

# Get type-specific berries
fire_berries = fruitys_client.get_fruitys_by_type_effect("fire")
water_berries = fruitys_client.get_fruitys_by_type_effect("water")
print(f"Fire berries: {len(fire_berries)}, Water berries: {len(water_berries)}")
```

### Example 1: Defensive Team Building

```python
from revomonauto.revomon.clients import FruitysClient

fruitys_client = FruitysClient()

# Build defensive berry strategy for team
def build_berry_strategy(team_types, strategy="resist"):
    """
    Build optimal berry strategy based on team composition
    """
    berry_strategy = {
        'damage_reduction': [],
        'healing': [],
        'priority': [],
        'type_specific': []
    }

    if strategy == "resist":
        # Focus on type resistance berries
        resist_berries = fruitys_client.get_damage_reducing_fruitys()

        # Match berries to team types
        for team_type in team_types:
            type_berries = fruitys_client.get_fruitys_by_type_effect(team_type)
            berry_strategy['type_specific'].extend(type_berries)

        berry_strategy['damage_reduction'] = resist_berries[:3]  # Top 3 resist berries

    elif strategy == "sustain":
        # Focus on healing berries
        healing_berries = fruitys_client.get_healing_fruitys()
        berry_strategy['healing'] = healing_berries[:4]  # Top 4 healing berries

    elif strategy == "speed":
        # Focus on priority berries
        priority_berries = fruitys_client.get_priority_fruitys()
        berry_strategy['priority'] = priority_berries

    return berry_strategy

# Build strategy for elemental team
team_types = ["fire", "water", "grass", "electric"]
resist_strategy = build_berry_strategy(team_types, "resist")

print("=== Berry Strategy ===")
print(f"Damage reduction: {[b['name'] for b in resist_strategy['damage_reduction']]}")
print(f"Type-specific: {[b['name'] for b in resist_strategy['type_specific']]}")
```

### Example 2: Type Weakness Mitigation

```python
# Mitigate team type weaknesses with berries
def mitigate_type_weaknesses(team_types, known_weaknesses):
    """
    Find berries that help against team weaknesses
    """
    mitigation_plan = []

    for weakness in known_weaknesses:
        # Find berries that resist this weakness type
        resist_berries = fruitys_client.get_fruitys_by_type_effect(weakness)

        if resist_berries:
            mitigation_plan.append({
                'weakness': weakness,
                'berries': resist_berries[:2],  # Top 2 options
                'mitigation_type': 'resistance'
            })
        else:
            # Look for general damage reduction
            general_resist = fruitys_client.get_damage_reducing_fruitys()
            mitigation_plan.append({
                'weakness': weakness,
                'berries': general_resist[:1],  # Fallback option
                'mitigation_type': 'general'
            })

    return mitigation_plan

# Mitigate common weaknesses

    print(f"{weakness['weakness']} weakness:")
    for berry in weakness['berries']:
        print(f"  {berry['name']}: {berry['description'][:60]}...")
```

### Example 3: Healing Strategy Optimization

# Optimize healing berry usage for different battle lengths
def optimize_healing_strategy(battle_length="medium"):
    """
    Optimize healing berry selection based on battle duration
    """
    healing_berries = fruitys_client.get_healing_fruitys()

        immediate_heal = [b for b in healing_berries
                         if "instant" in b['description'].lower() or "immediate" in b['description'].lower()]
        return immediate_heal or healing_berries[:2]

    elif battle_length == "long":

# Optimize for tournament (long battles)
tournament_healing = optimize_healing_strategy("long")
print("=== Tournament Healing Strategy ===")
for berry in tournament_healing:
    print(f"{berry['name']}: {berry['description']}")
```

    }

    # Get common attacking types that threaten the team
    common_threats = ["fire", "water", "grass", "electric", "ground", "flying", "ice", "rock"]

    for threat in common_threats:
        # Check if any berry helps against this threat
        threat_berries = [b for b in available_berries
                         if threat.lower() in b['description'].lower()]

        if threat_berries:
            coverage_analysis['covered_weaknesses'].add(threat)
            coverage_analysis['coverage_quality'][threat] = len(threat_berries)
        else:
            coverage_analysis['uncovered_weaknesses'].add(threat)

    coverage_percentage = (len(coverage_analysis['covered_weaknesses']) / len(common_threats)) * 100

    return coverage_analysis, coverage_percentage

# Analyze coverage for typical team
coverage, percentage = analyze_weakness_coverage(["fire", "water", "grass"])

print("=== Weakness Coverage ===")
print(f"Covered weaknesses: {len(coverage['covered_weaknesses'])}/{len(['fire', 'water', 'grass', 'electric', 'ground', 'flying', 'ice', 'rock'])}")
print(f"Coverage percentage: {percentage:.1f}%")
print(f"Covered: {sorted(coverage['covered_weaknesses'])}")
print(f"Uncovered: {sorted(coverage['uncovered_weaknesses'])}")
```
